# Releases
In order to finalize a release the change log should be updated to show the features that were added, changed and fixed.
In the releases a tag can be created, the format "vx.x", where incrementing the first x represents a major change in the application and incrementing the second x represents smaller changes.
The pre-releases are marked by "v0.x" to show that at the time of that commit the application wasn't ready for being used by an end-user.
